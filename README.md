`pony_gp` is an implementation of Genetic Programming(GP), see e.g.
<http://geneticprogramming.com>. The purpose of `pony_gp` is to describe how
the GP algorithm works. The intended use is for teaching. The aim is to allow
the developer to quickly start using and developing. The design is supposed
to be simple, self contained and use core python libraries.

# Run

Find a equation for the input given an output and an equation that
transforms input. **Note** this is currently under development for
coevolution, i.e. coupled populations where fitness is based on the
adversaries that the solution is tested against. (We name the
populations "attacker" and "defender")

```python python pony_gp.py --config=configs.ini ``` 

Example output:
```
TODO

```

If you wish to,
change the paramaters from the `configs.ini` file to your desired
paramaters or allow it to remain at its default values.

The input is generated according to `configs.ini`. The
exemplars are generated from `y = x0^2 + x1^2`. 

- The "attacker" transform the input points to new points and the
  fitness is based on the error from the "defender" output compared to
  the target value on the new input points.

- The "defender" minimizes the error of its output and target value
  given input.

## Requirements

Python 3

## Usage

```
usage: pony_gp.py [-h] [-p POPULATION_SIZE] [-m MAX_DEPTH] [-e ELITE_SIZE]
                  [-g GENERATIONS] [--ts TOURNAMENT_SIZE] [-s SEED]
                  [--cp CROSSOVER_PROBABILITY] [--mp MUTATION_PROBABILITY]
                  --config CONFIG [--verbose]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p POPULATION_SIZE, --population_size POPULATION_SIZE
                        Population size is the number of individual solutions
  -m MAX_DEPTH, --max_depth MAX_DEPTH
                        Max depth of tree. Partly determines the search space
                        of the solutions
  -e ELITE_SIZE, --elite_size ELITE_SIZE
                        Elite size is the number of best individual solutions
                        that are preserved between generations
  -g GENERATIONS, --generations GENERATIONS
                        Number of generations. The number of iterations of the
                        search loop.
  --ts TOURNAMENT_SIZE, --tournament_size TOURNAMENT_SIZE
                        Tournament size. The number of individual solutions
                        that are compared when determining which solutions are
                        inserted into the next generation(iteration) of the
                        search loop
  -s SEED, --seed SEED  Random seed. For replication of runs of the EA. The
                        search is stochastic and and replication of the
                        results are guaranteed the random seed
  --cp CROSSOVER_PROBABILITY, --crossover_probability CROSSOVER_PROBABILITY
                        Crossover probability, [0.0,1.0]. The probability of
                        two individual solutions to be varied by the crossover
                        operator
  --mp MUTATION_PROBABILITY, --mutation_probability MUTATION_PROBABILITY
                        Mutation probability, [0.0, 1.0]. The probability of
                        an individual solutions to be varied by the mutation
                        operator
  --config CONFIG       Config file in Python INI format. Overridden by CLI-
                        arguments.
  --verbose, -v         Verbose printing
```

## Output
The "attacker" fitness is based on the error of the defenders evaluated on the points generated by the attacker.
The "defender" fitness is based on the error of the attacker points evaluated
